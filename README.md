Have so many ideas that you


Ideas are the seeds to all innovation. The human mind is always thinking, analysing and processing. These thoughts and innovative ideas pass through our mind in such great numbr we can't always keep a track of them, hence lose loads of these ideas. I think of these ideas as seeds. So I made this thought managing application wherein people can categorize idea and save them in tese thought boards. They can have people who have tried similar ideas share their experience and develop from there.
